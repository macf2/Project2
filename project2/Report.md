My data set is about cats. EX:
Id,Breed,Age (Years),Weight (kg),Color,Gender
1,Russian Blue,19,7,Tortoiseshell,Female

queue:
enqueue and dequeue are constant
search and print are linear

stack:
push and pop are constant
search and print are linear

justify my use of pointers:
the queue is just a linked list basically. if you want to insert or remove its constant because
you only have to swap pointers around 

the objects change order when you push them onto the stack and read them off.
this is because a stack is first in last out
